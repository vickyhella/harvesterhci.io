This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n  a. No precision is lost\n  b. No fractional digits will be emitted\n  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.\nThe sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n  1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\"\n  1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.","type":"string"}}}}}},"evictionStrategy":{"description":"EvictionStrategy can be set to \"LiveMigrate\" if the VirtualMachineInstance should be migrated instead of shut-off in case of a node drain.","type":"string"},"hostname":{"description":"Specifies the hostname of the vmi If not specified, the hostname will be set to the name of the vmi, if dhcp or cloud-init is configured properly.","type":"string"},"livenessProbe":{"description":"Periodic probe of VirtualMachineInstance liveness.

This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\n\nWhen a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\".

Specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
(Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

Specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
(Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

Specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
(Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
(Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

Specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.

Specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
(Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

Specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
(Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

Specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
(Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
